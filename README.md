Vision:
AppBundle will provide the heavy mobile users a simple, fast and reliable storage solution for their applications and data without an overhead of memory shortage. Existing solutions do not provide an easy way to store the entire application on cloud. AppBundle will do this for the user’s by storing the APK of the application on the cloud servers, allowing the users to retrieve it as and when required; giving the feel like the application is working on the local device.
Motivation:
The mobile application industry is booming, with more than 2.7 billion smartphone users and 1.35 billion tablet users worldwide. If you spend a second during the day looking around, I believe you will find everyone’s eyes on their mobile devices. That being said, about 90% of mobile time is spent on apps. This is inspiring for anyone who owns or plans to develop applications. In order to succeed in this area, users need to download and use your application. The problem on users' side was they would receive a warning message of "Insufficient storage space". Multiple categories of applications are downloaded by the users based on their preference. Amongst them the major category that consumes large chunks of memory are games, business, market, visual designs, social media etc. All of this cannot be installed due to insufficient memory.
